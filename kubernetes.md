# Kubernetes

## Kubernetes for dummies

Before starting messing up with Kubernetes you need to know few, but important, concepts about it. Since Kubernetes has a lot of functionalities it could be difficult to get them all at the fist time. Since we're simple Kuberentes user we don't want to race with the official documentation, thus, if you don't understand some concepts, we suggest you to study from here.

In this section you'll find a summary of the basic concepts of Kubernetes that can be useful to read in case you need to refresh your memory.

### Kubernetes basic concepts

#### Pod

A pod the most basic building block for Kubernetes. A pod usually contains one or more container \(if the containers are higly coupled\), but Kubernetes it's able to manage different virtualization technologies \(e.g. [Virtual Machines](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt)\). Pods have a life cycle, where it can assume these states \([stealing the table directly from the official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/)\):

* **Pending**: The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the Container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
* **Running**: The Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the Containers have been created. At least one Container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
* **Succeeded**: All Containers in the Pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
* **Failed**: All Containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one Container has terminated in failure. That is, the Container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system.
* **Unknown**: For some reason the state of the Pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the Pod.

A pod can have different conditions too:

* **PodScheduled**: the Pod has been scheduled to a node;
* **Ready**: the Pod is able to serve requests and should be added to the load balancing pools of all matching Services;
* **Initialized**: all [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers) have started successfully;
* **Unschedulable**: the scheduler cannot schedule the Pod right now, for example due to lacking of resources or other constraints;
* **Unschedulable**: the scheduler cannot schedule the Pod right now, for example due to lacking of resources or other constraints;

#### Service

Since pods for their nature are highly volatile, applications that use them can not rely on their IP address. To solve this problem, the Service implementation in Kubernetes assure a stable IP, even if different pods in this service crash and gets restarted by a ReplicaSet \(witch will not be explain in this guide, but it basically scale up and down pods - [more info here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)\)

Citing the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), the Service is:  
_A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them - sometimes called a micro-service._

![Example of a service](.gitbook/assets/module_04_services.png)

#### Volume

When Pods saves data on a node, this data is destinated to perish. Kubernetes offers a way to save this data and to possibly make it available to all the pods replicas, offering a transparent layer where pods are not aware of working with data shared other pods, even located in other nodes. This functionality is called Volume, and there are many different drivers, that range from a simple local storage to glusterfs.

#### Namespace

Namespaces are intend to be used when there are multiple users using the cluster, or to separate multiple projects.

### Kubernetes architectural concepts

#### Node

A node is the building block for a Kubernetes cluster. Every must have at least the kubelet daemon \(to manage kubernetes functionalities\) and a container manager \(e.g. Docker, VirtualBox\) running. A node runs pods and can communicate with other nodes in the same cluster

![Schema illustrating the elements in a node](.gitbook/assets/module_03_nodes.png)

#### Master

The master node is the one that starts a cluster, and that manage the slaves. In the master node only some pods can run in it \(e.g. the dashboard\).

The master generates the token for the slaves to join, and coordinates the federation with other clusters. In a cluster, there is the possibility to have multiple master to assure high availability.

#### Slave

A slave is a node that run the pods that the master schedule. It can also be part of a PersistentVolume storage \(like GlusterFS\) and if it goes down another slave will take care of the pods that where running on it. Slaves can join existing cluster via a given token.

#### Networking

Kubernetes, even if it uses Docker as a matter of fact for running containers, it has its networking structure. In particular, it delegates the network operations \(like packet forwarding\) to different managers, like for example Flannel or Calico.

Every nodes in the cluster runs a pod called `kubeproxy`, that communicates with the `kube-api` pod \(running in the master\) and the `kube-dns` \(for Kubernetes &lt;=1.9.x\) or `CoreDNS` \(for Kubernetes &gt;=1.10.x\). kubeproxy assure transparent communication between pods in the same cluster, and kube-api allows to call Kubernetes services. kube-dns/CoreDNS manage DNS request coming from the pods, differencianting the one that goes outside the cluster from the other that point internally.

Additional information about Flannel, Kubernetes and Docker networking can be found here:

## Installing Kubernetes

We performed our Kubernetes installation in a Openstack environment. Since we used the Openstack of our school department, the administrator have given us a virtual machine, Openstack-CLI, to perform cli operations. From now, our scripts assume you're in a machine with access to openstack, and that you have sourced your openrc.sh script before continuing.

We performed our first installation with Ubuntu, but since it was not fully successful, we changed distro with CentOS. In this tab you can find the two versions.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CentOS" %}


### Installing Kubernetes on CentOS

To install Kubernetes on CentOS 7 we develop a script available [on this page](https://github.com/Augugrumi/init-script/tree/centos/kubernetes). With CentOS is possible to have a complete installation with a GlusterFS-PersistendStorage correctly set.

We haven't made up nothing, but we've googled a lot before coming to this solution. Here are our sources:

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ubuntu" %}
### Installing Kubernetes on Ubuntu 16.04 \(Xenial Xerus\)

We first tried to install Kubernetes on Ubuntu, is the distro we're more familiar with. To install Kubernetes on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus we develop a script available [on this page](https://github.com/Augugrumi/init-script/tree/master/kubernetes).  Please note the this is not a complete installation! We were not able to get GlusterFS working with Ubuntu, thus we changed distro with CentOS.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Persistent Storage

### Prerequisites

* A working installation of Kubernetes
* Python \(2.7\) installed and available on all Kubernetes nodes

### GlusterFS

![](.gitbook/assets/glusterkube.png)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CentOS" %}
#### GlusterFS on CentOS 7

To enable persistent storage in Kubernetes with Glusterfs you need at least three nodes. As we've already written above, we deployed our Kubernetes cluster using CentOS 7.

Since we're running our cluster on a Openstack environment, we attached one volume per VM. If you're in our shoes, just create some empty volumes and attach them to nodes you want to configure with glusterfs.

First of all, you need to install `gluster-server` on all the nodes that will join the storage and `gluster-fuse` to provide `mount.glusterfs` as an option to mount Gluster file systems. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
sudo yum install -y centos-release-gluster && \
sudo yum install -y glusterfs-server glusterfs-fuse
```

Our next step is to load different kenel modules, using `modprobe`:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'modprobe dm_snapshot && modprobe dm_mirror && modprobe dm_thin_pool'
```

To make this change permanent, create a new file in `/etc/modules-load.d/gluster.conf` with the following content:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="gluster.conf" %}
```text
dm_snapshot
dm_mirror
dm_thin_pool
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

At this point, enable the `glusterd` daemon to start at every system start:

```bash
sudo systemctl start glusterd && sudo systemctl enable glusterd
```

For all the nodes you installed glusterfs you need to apply a particular label in you Kubernetes cluster. In a terminal, type:

```bash
kubectl label node <node name> storagenode=glusterfs
```

[According the gluster-kubernetes setup guide](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/setup-guide.md), you should also check that the following ports are reachable:

* 2222
* 24007
* 24008
* 49152-49251

On top of that, you'll need to grant access to your root account while installing all the stuff we need. In CentOS, if like us you're using the CloudImg image, you need to access every machine and type:

```bash
sudo su # gain superpowers
cd /root/
nano .ssh/authorized_keys
# edit the first line in the follwing way: from the sub-string starting
# as "ssh-rsa" untill the end put the content in a new line, while comment
# the whole line
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config # un-comment "PermitRootLogin: yes"
systemctl restart sshd
```

At this point, you need to clone kubernetes-glusterfs, the repository that contains a magic script that will figure out all the necessary stuff \(e.g. heketi\), `gk-deploy`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes.git
cd gluster-kubernetes/deploy
```

We're reaching our goal, hold on! Now we need to define our topology. To do so, create a `tolopogy.json` from the sample \(`topology.json.sample`\) and edit to fit your necessities. Here, we report our:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="topology.json" %}
```javascript
{
 "clusters": [
   {
     "nodes": [
       {
         "node": {
           "hostnames": {
             "manage": [
               "192.168.29.26"
             ],
             "storage": [
               "192.168.29.26"
             ]
           },
           "zone": 1
         },
         "devices": [
           "/dev/vdb"
         ]
       },
       {
         "node": {
           "hostnames": {
             "manage": [
               "192.168.29.19"
             ],
             "storage": [
               "192.168.29.19"
             ]
           },
           "zone": 1
         },
         "devices": [
           "/dev/vdb"
         ]
       },
       {
         "node": {
           "hostnames": {
             "manage": [
               "192.168.29.22"
             ],
             "storage": [
               "192.168.29.22"
             ]
           },
           "zone": 1
         },
         "devices": [
           "/dev/vdb"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
 ]
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

As you can see, in "manage" we have put the IP address of our machine, even if we already defined their addresses in `/etc/hosts`. 

Ta-daan! 🎉 Now we're ready to deploy our Gluster cluster. From the master, type in a terminal the following command:

```bash
# assuming you still are in ~/blabla/gluster-kubernetes/deploy/
./gk-deploy -s <path/to/your/private/key> --ssh-user root --ssh-port 22 topology.json -y
```

At the end, if everything goes correctly, you should see a `StorageClass` template. Copy it deploy to your Kubernetes through `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl create -f glusterstorageclass.yaml
```

Optionally, you can set it as default `StorageClass` with the following command:

```bash
kubectl patch -f glusterstorageclass.yaml \
-p'{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
```

{% tab title="Ubuntu" %}
#### GlusterFS on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS \(Xenial Xerus\)

We tried to install GlusterFS on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS but we failed. We followed the setup guide available [at this link](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/setup-guide.md) on Gluster [official repository](https://github.com/gluster). 

The first problem we encountered was the installation of all dependencies. In fact installing from apt-get the glusterfs-server glusterd wont start. Finally installing `glusterfs-server`,  `glusterfs-client` and `glusterfs-common` we solved this first issue. At the end `glusted` was available on all Kubernetes slave nodes.

We opened all other steps \(enabling ssh as root on all slave machine, that was not specified in the guide\) and we run the installation by the command:

```bash
./gk-deploy -s <path/to/your/private/key> --ssh-user root --ssh-port 22 topology.json -yv
```

As in the CentOS installation but the master node \(as we see in logs\) was not able to contact `glusterd` on nodes. We verified that all nodes were not on other gluster cluster, ports are not reachable and  ssh was not available but everything seemed to work. 

At the end, as we does not have any strict requisites on the OS to use, we decided to do not proceed down to this road.
