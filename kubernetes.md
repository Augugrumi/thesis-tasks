## Installing Kubernetes

### Installing Kubernetes on Ubuntu 16.04 \(Xenial Xerus\)

To install Kubernetes on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus we develop a script available [on this page](https://github.com/Augugrumi/init-script/tree/master/kubernetes). It assumes you are inside on Openstack-CLI in order to find out some information on VM to which you specify the IP addresses.

### Installing Kubernetes on CentOS

To install Kubernetes on CentOS 7 we develop a script available [on this page](https://github.com/Augugrumi/init-script/tree/centos/kubernetes). It assumes you are inside on Openstack-CLI in order to find out some information on VM to which you specify the IP addresses.

## Persistent Storage

### Prerequisites

* A working installation of Kubernetes
* Python \(2.7\) installed and available on all Kubernetes nodes

### GlusterFS

#### GlusterFS on CentOS 7

To enable persistent storage in Kubernetes with Glusterfs you need at least three nodes. As we've already written above, we deployed our Kubernetes cluster using CentOS 7.

Since we're running our cluster on a Openstack environment, we attached one volume per VM. If you're in our shoes, just create some empty volumes and attach them to nodes you want to configure with glusterfs.

First of all, you need to install `gluster-server` on all the nodes that will join the storage and `gluster-fuse` to provide `mount.glusterfs` as an option to mount Gluster file systems. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
sudo yum install -y centos-release-gluster && \
sudo yum install -y glusterfs-server glusterfs-fuse
```

Our next step is to load different kenel modules, using `modprobe`:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'modprobe dm_snapshot && modprobe dm_mirror && modprobe dm_thin_pool'
```

To make this change permanent, create a new file in `/etc/modules-load.d/gluster.conf` with the following content:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="gluster.conf" %}
```text
dm_snapshot
dm_mirror
dm_thin_pool
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

At this point, enable the `glusterd` daemon to start at every system start:

```bash
sudo systemctl start glusterd && sudo systemctl enable glusterd
```

For all the nodes you installed glusterfs you need to apply a particular label in you Kubernetes cluster. In a terminal, type:

```bash
kubectl label node <node name> storagenode=glusterfs
```

[According the gluster-kubernetes setup guide](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/setup-guide.md), you should also check that the following ports are reachable:

* 2222
* 24007
* 24008
* 49152-49251

On top of that, you'll need to grant access to your root account while installing all the stuff we need. In CentOS, if like us you're using the CloudImg image, you need to access every machine and type:

```bash
sudo su # gain superpowers
cd /root/
nano .ssh/authorized_keys
# edit the first line in the follwing way: from the sub-string starting
# as "ssh-rsa" untill the end put the content in a new line, while comment
# the whole line
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config # un-comment "PermitRootLogin: yes"
systemctl restart sshd
```

At this point, you need to clone kubernetes-glusterfs, the repository that contains a magic script that will figure out all the necessary stuff \(e.g. heketi\), `gk-deploy`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes.git
cd gluster-kubernetes/deploy
```

We're reaching our goal, hold on! Now we need to define our tolopoly. To do so, create a `tolopogy.json` from the sample \(`topology.json.sample`\) and edit to fit your neccessities. Here, we report our:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="topology.json" %}
```javascript
{
 "clusters": [
   {
     "nodes": [
       {
         "node": {
           "hostnames": {
             "manage": [
               "192.168.29.26"
             ],
             "storage": [
               "192.168.29.26"
             ]
           },
           "zone": 1
         },
         "devices": [
           "/dev/vdb"
         ]
       },
       {
         "node": {
           "hostnames": {
             "manage": [
               "192.168.29.19"
             ],
             "storage": [
               "192.168.29.19"
             ]
           },
           "zone": 1
         },
         "devices": [
           "/dev/vdb"
         ]
       },
       {
         "node": {
           "hostnames": {
             "manage": [
               "192.168.29.22"
             ],
             "storage": [
               "192.168.29.22"
             ]
           },
           "zone": 1
         },
         "devices": [
           "/dev/vdb"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
 ]
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

As you can see, in "manage" we have put the IP address of our machine, even if we already defined their addresses in `/etc/hosts`. 

Ta-daan! ðŸŽ‰ Now we're ready to deploy our Gluster cluster. From the master, type in a terminal the following command:

```bash
# assuming you still are in ~/blabla/gluster-kubernetes/deploy/
./gk-deploy -s <path/to/your/private/key> --ssh-user root --ssh-port 22 topology.json -y
```

At the end, if everything goes correctly, you should see a `StorageClass` template. Copy it deploy to your Kubernetes through `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl create -f glusterstorageclass.yaml
```

Optionally, you can set it as default `StorageClass` with the following command:

```bash
kubectl patch -f glusterstorageclass.yaml \
-p'{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
```

#### GlusterFS on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS \(Xenial Xerus\)

We tried to install GlusterFS on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS but we failed. We followed the setup guide available [at this link](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/setup-guide.md) on Gluster [official repository](https://github.com/gluster). 

The first problem we encountered was the installation of all dependencies. In fact installing from apt-get the glusterfs-server glusterd wont start. Finally installing `glusterfs-server`,  `glusterfs-client` and `glusterfs-common` we solved this first issue. At the end `glusted` was available on all Kubernetes slave nodes.

We opened all other steps \(enabling ssh as root on all slave machine, that was not specified in the guide\) and we run the installation by the command:

```bash
./gk-deploy -s <path/to/your/private/key> --ssh-user root --ssh-port 22 topology.json -yv
```

As in the CentOS installation but the master node \(as we see in logs\) was not able to contact `glusterd` on nodes. We verified that all nodes were not on other gluster cluster, ports are not reachable and  ssh was not available but everything seemed to work. 

At the end, as we does not have any strict requisites on the OS to use, we decided to do not proceed down to this road.
